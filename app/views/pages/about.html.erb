During her time at University, she performed in several musicals and operas, and sang with many different choirs. Whilst Alex began her training as a classical singer, she also trained as a musical theatre vocalist, and so offers a very versatile service in performing whatever is required.

Alex understands the true importance of a wedding day, and prides herself on working closely with clients to provide them with a bespoke and unique service.</p>
